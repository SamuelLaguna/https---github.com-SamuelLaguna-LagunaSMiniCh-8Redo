//Peer Review: Rafael Manzo, 
    The program runs, but it seems to break into a loop after it asks for the initial guess of the random number it has generated. Your code would output a clean console if you added a Console.Clear(); at the begining of your script. I would come back to this one when you get some time. Otherwise good
